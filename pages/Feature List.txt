# Feature List

## Backlog
- page revision history 
- automated backup
- predictive/suggested search
- autocomplete/suggested link in editor
  - Maybe an `autocreate links` button at the bottom
- Tab input allowed in browser editor
  - [interesting related stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69983667/ability-to-enter-tab-characters-in-a-textfield)
- Something to stop like, Alberich and alberich pages being made
- ToC generation
- line up edit text in title bar
- line numbers in editor?
- footer
- Extract GQ stuff so this can be released
- image gallery?
  - allow tags on images?
  - both of these are non-markdown features
- autoindent on editor
- md prettier function on save
- fix the weird bullet point spacing
- The idea of a graph-like structure between pages (related to Xanadu) is intriguing. This must be thought on.
- The markdown guide is big and clunky.
  - make a slimmer, simpler version (leaving the big one available ofc)
  - Find a way to have the 'guide' visible/available without leaving the page; people should be able to get stuck into the flow of creating, not checking a manual every 30 seconds.

## In Progress
- within-page links
- jump floating buttons are still in weird places. and ugly

## Done
- Auto scaling of editing boxes
- hidden tags in pages
- box around `code` blocks
- jump to top/bottom floating buttons
