[Military Section](#Military)

## Summary
[fuck](http://creanderson.co.uk)
The kingdom of Angelwatch and its namesake city sits on the south end of The King’s Road, nestled against the forest. As of 119BA Angelwatch is a puppet-state of the Marian Empire. The empire has placed restrictions on the use of magic there to help it maintain control.

# The City and its People

## Magic

### Factions

#### Circus of Potas
This is a combination of college, guild, and theater of magic users. The circus specializes in the training of illusion and enchantment magic, as well as bardic magic of all kinds. As the name suggests, they have a significant connection to the cult of Potas.

#### The Circle of Vahit

This is a druidic circle based in the nearby forest, inspired directly by the teachings of the god Vahit.

#### Angstrom’s Academy of the Arcane

Founded and run by “The Great Wizard Angstrom” (as he styles himself), this local school of magic takes in students from as young as 5 human-year-equivalents. It’s not very big \- maybe 30 students \- and entirely taught by Angstrom.

#### The Mancer Corp

A branch of the Angelwatch military which specializes in war magic, the Mancer Corp has been significantly damaged by the changes brought by the Marian Empire. 

#### The School of Economancy & Vocation

Far from being a school, this is actually a guild of merchants dealing in magical goods and services, which has members all across the King’s Road.

### Characters

#### Angstrom Arsani III

The Great Wizard Angstrom Arsani III was trained in Good Question and spent most of his career as the court wizard to a noble family in Adamar. After an accident involving their son and a transmutation spell, he was “encouraged” to move on, and settled in Angelwatch shortly after. He’s been teaching at this Academy for 40 years now.

#### Ringmaster Woxan

Woxan Retcher is a bard with little interest in the politics of magic, whose main goal is to expand the circus to other kingdoms in the region. She is currently preparing a troupe of performers to send on tour along the King’s Road, to raise funds and gauge local support.

#### Head Druid Moonai

Moonai is a wood elf druid and devout follower of Vahit. She has recently taken leadership of the circle after the previous head druid passed. She has more extreme views than her predecessor, and wants to convince the circle to push back harder against the exploitation and destruction of forest within the kingdom.

#### Archmancer Valoron

Archmancer Valoron has held his position for nearly 40 years, and shares his Queen’s ambitions of removing empire presence from the kingdom. His motivations for this are largely political; he cares less than you’d expect about the restriction of magic, as he believes any caster worth their salt can still do great damage with low-level spells and creative thinking.

### Locations

#### The Mancer Camp

See [The Watchers’ Nest](#The-Watchers’-Nest). This section of The Nest is dedicated to the training of war magic and storage of magical weapons. 

#### Angstrom’s Academy

The academy consists of 2 locations: Angstrom’s mansion, where most classes are conducted and the school's library is located, and Angstrom’s estate in the country \- which is where the more practical side of magic is taught, well away from potential ‘collateral damage’.

#### The Circus

The circus is held in a large circus tent in the center of the city’s largest park. It has been enchanted to be much, much bigger on the inside so that it can fit all the facilities needed to operate under one roof.

#### Magic Stores and Services

##### Tonics & Phonics

This store sells potions, salves, alchemical ingredients, and also a small selection of magical instruments. Run by Heid (a herbalist with connections to the Circle of Vahit) and Pasini (A luthier trained in the Circus)

##### Shoppes Sorcery Shop

This store sells spell scrolls, wands, and magic staves. This store is owned by the ghost of Hao Shoppes (a sorcerer who died 150 years ago) and staffed by his apprentice Kyle.

##### Grimhammer’s Magical Sundries

They sell a bit of everything, but nothing super specialized or particularly strong. They are cheap though. Grimhammer (he insists it’s his actual name) is a wizard who used to work as a caravan guard/guide \- specialises in divination and abjuration.

##### The Blessed, The Cursed, and The Enchanted

Identification, enchantments, blessing, and curse removal. Anything magic item related, they can do.  This shop is run by the Tospeo sisters \- triplets each in different ‘classes’. Sami is a wizard, Tolsa is a warlock, and Vee is a sorcerer.

## Social

### Factions

#### Traditionalists

Angelwatch has a long tradition as a welcoming “melting pot” of people with great personal freedom. Many feel like the changes imposed by Adamar (or even the Indigo Royal Family) are changing that culture and pushing the city towards isolationism.

#### Angels of the Forest

A sort of scouts-adjacent group who value conservation of the forests. When they encounter local druids they often help with their goals. Some members have more militant views.

#### Society of the Cobalt Eye

A group of amateur historians and genealogists.

#### The Bricks

The Bricks are a local gang, known for extortion, smuggling, and providing muscle for those who need protection off the books.

#### Silver Fox

The silver fox are a criminal organisation that runs almost every crime there is across the kingdom. They don’t see the Bricks as rivals, considering them useless amateurs.

### Characters

#### Shadoweave Fullbright

#### Mirage Fullbright

Wood elf, 

#### Harvey Gammain

Prominent traditionalist. Old enough to remember the old royal family, and sees that period as the peak of Angelwatch’s power and culture. Secretly working with a member of the Eye to find any living relatives of the previous royal family in the hopes of placing them back on the throne.

#### Wesley Tonnnington

Member of the Society of the Cobalt Eye, currently focused on untangling the events of the 119BA war.

#### Little Brick

Real name Herbert Mason, this Halfling has ambitions of pushing the Silver Fox out of the city, building a criminal empire to rival all.

#### Tack Goron

The Orc leader of the silver fox. His cunning and silver tongue had kept him at the top (and away from the law) for many years \- that and his brutal hand-to-hand training from his time in Jarg-Uroth’s army.

### Locations

A number of taverns

#### 	The Orb and Seer

A town square or two  
Social “Clubs”

## Political

### Factions

#### The Marian Empire

The empire has interest in Angelwatch purely as a strategic asset, but it’s not of great import to them . They have no strong desire to extract its resources or to annex the city, and as such they prefer a lighter touch to keep them in line. Basic restrictions on magic, a permanent embassy, and a small military fortification is all they feel necessary to keep the city in line.

#### The Royal Family

The house of Indigo has ruled Angelwatch only a couple generations. They were once an influential clan in the Rivermore senate, but many of them were exiled after an unsuccessful coup. They moved to Angelwatch and eventually managed to overthrow the previous royal family \- although this was a few generations ago, some still view them as outsiders. The previous king signed the treaty which made them a protectorate of the empire, granting security but stripping them of much political freedom. The current monarch is eager to find a way of escaping the control of Adamar without starting a war.

#### Other King’s Road Cities

Lamplight is largely indifferent to Angelwatch, although in the past they have cooperated against Highport as a common enemy. Angelwatch frequently finds itself at odds with Highport over control of land and resources in the massive forest. There has sometimes been tension between Angelwatch and Rivermore over border territories, but more often economic policy which affects traffic along the King’s Road \- a major source of income for both cities. 

#### Outlying Villages

???

### Characters

#### Marian Ambassador

Ervor Dunatsk currently serves as the Marian ambassador to Angelwatch. He acts to both enforce the treaty, and also to push public opinion in favour of the empire.

#### Royal Family

##### The Late King Edric 

King Edric made the decision to submit to Marian control early in the war, and since has been a controversial figure in the minds of the populus.

##### Queen Evana II

Queen Evana (b. 130BA) was raised in Angelwatch, and from the age of 11 served as a diplomatic “guest” of the empire as part of the peace treaty. She has ruled since her father’s death in 112BA, and her childhood experience has given her a strong distrust of the empire; since reconstruction finished several years ago she has been working to regain independence.

##### Prince Consort Uuval

Evana’s husband Uuval comes from an old noble family of Angelwatch, and Evana’s marriage to him was intended as a show of loyalty to the people of Angelwatch, and a rejection of the empire.

##### Princess Sera

The daughter of Evana and Uuval, Princess Sera was born in 106BA and is first in line for the throne. She is named for a mythical hero from the region.

##### Prince Edric

Edric is Queen Evana’s younger brother. He was too young to remember the war, having been born only a few years before his father’s death. Unlike his sister, he has no dislike of the empire.

### Locations

The palace exists, and is old. It backs onto the forest.

Originally just a large marquee in the center of the market plaza made to keep the rain away, the Guildhall is now one of the largest buildings in the city, boasting 3 floors with a footprint covering almost 1/3 of the plaza, all raised above the ground by stone pillars to maintain its original purpose. 

#### Company of the Bear Headquarters

The CoB headquarters consists of several terraced buildings the company bought and knocked through into one long property. Each of the many arms of the company are mostly sequestered to a single building (referred to as houses, which is a bit confusing given they did actually used to be houses), with the central property \- known as The Company House \- serving as the public face and hosting the upper management offices.

#### Loggers Union

The logger’s union meets at a sort of campsite in the forest, with a kind of log-bench-amphitheatre arranged around a bonfire.

#### The Trapper Camp

Like the Logger’s Union, the trappers guild doesn’t maintain a permanent base, instead borrowing the Market Guildhall for their meetings and keeping a single office there for day-to-day operations.

#### Owkys Farm

The Owkys family have farmed their land for generations, claiming to have been among the first settlers in Angelwatch. They’ve acquired much land over time, and are a significant provider of wheat and flour in the kingdom. As a result, they have more influence than most working people do.

#### Moonwood Orchard

Run by the Llywn family (wood elves), they grow a number of fruiting plants, most notably Moonwood. Moonwood is very difficult to cultivate as it can only grow in moonlight and needs protection from the sun, but it can produce goodberries, which make it very valuable.

#### Stores

Also see [Magic Stores and Services](#magic-stores-and-services)

The gnome halfling inventor Treblet Burrow sells all sorts of toys and minor illusion items, sometimes carrying items valuable to Artificers.

##### Angelwatch Ranch

This ranch just outside the city limits raises all manner of mundane draught animals, pets, beasts, and some of the less dangerous magical creatures. They have a small shop front in the city for sales, but all the real work is at the ranch. Owned by the Ogoligano clan, a family of Goliaths whose size and strength makes handling these beasts much easier.

# History

Angelwatch was settled in the south of the region, on the edge of a great forest. Its position near the river Mar, on the edge of imperial territory, gives it significant strategic value \- if it had the strength, Angelwatch could blockade all trade to Adamar from the north.   
	During the war of 119BA Angelwatch was one of the first cities to fall to the Marian Empire, and since then it has been a puppet-state of the empire. The empire has placed restrictions on the use of magic there, to help it maintain control.
