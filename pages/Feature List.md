# Feature List

## Backlog
- page revision history 
- automated backup
- predictive/suggested search
- autocomplete/suggested link in editor
  - Maybe an `autocreate links` button at the bottom
  - [interesting related stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69983667/ability-to-enter-tab-characters-in-a-textfield)
- Something to stop like, Alberich and alberich pages being made
- ToC generation
- line numbers in editor?
- footer
- Extract GQ stuff so this can be released
- allow tags on images?
- autoindent on editor
- md prettier function on save
- The idea of a graph-like structure between pages (related to Xanadu) is intriguing. This must be thought on.
- The markdown guide is big and clunky.
  - make a slimmer, simpler version (leaving the big one available ofc)
  - Find a way to have the 'guide' visible/available without leaving the page; people should be able to get stuck into the flow of creating, not checking a manual every 30 seconds.
- Ability to edit small blocks of a file - like an edit stuff in this heading area feature. Would need to find a way to merge into actual file, but would make some stuff much easier to do.
- password protection. Maybe three levels: Open, Write-protection, Read-Protection.
  - Should this be project based on page based? Page based is a lot of overhead...
- within-page links
- floating contents
- floating edit tools (e.g. insert image, bold, etc)
- page templates
- downloading resources/whole wiki
- modify search to ONLY use page names and tags
- find an actual Rich Text Editor and convert to markdown in the background??? feels like a cop-out
- fix unpredictable indentation rules for lists
- make edit/save/cancel buttons also float?

## Bugs
- line up edit text in title bar
- fix weird toolbar resizing

## In Progress


## Done
- Auto scaling of editing boxes
- hidden tags in pages
- box around `code` blocks
- jump to top/bottom floating buttons
  - **A compromise has been made**. jump floating buttons are still in weird places. and ugly.  
- make header fixed/float
- Toolbar: move search to center, add Home button on left. Redistribute page list and graph
- Tab input allowed in browser editor
- fix the weird bullet point spacing
- fix shortened footer position on small pages
- found how to override browser shortcuts (e.g. ctrl+b) to affect editor. CTRL + S now hits the save button
- add "\<hr\> " after h1, maybe h2 tags
- change all the file extensions from .txt to .md. It's weird that they're like that.
